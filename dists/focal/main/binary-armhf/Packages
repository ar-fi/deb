Description: USB automount daemon for AR-Fi Sync
 This piece of software is designed and implemented as a single-client daemon utility,
 intended for use by its client as source of notifications about mount/unmount events.
 Syncmount uses Linux kernel bindings to monitor attachment and detachment of USB mass storage devices and mounts found partitions/volumes with filesystems, supported by kernel.
 The nature of tasks, run by syncmount, requires root privileges to be able to mount filesystems.
